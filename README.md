# Subtract-Reverse-Lucas-Series-AssemLang
Assembly program to subtract first 10 elements of a Reverse Lucas series by using only MOV and SUB instruction. 
Generate each number in the series to compute the difference except the first two terms i.e. 76 and 47. Store and overwrite the result of subtraction in DX register.

29 = 76 – 47
18 = 47 – 29
Reverse Lucas series: 76, 47, 29, 18, 11, 7, 4, 3, 1, 2
